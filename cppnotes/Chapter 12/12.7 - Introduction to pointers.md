# Introduction to Pointers

When we declare a variable, a piece of memory will be assigned to this object. For example, variable x is assigned memory address 140. With variables, we don't need to worry about what specific memory addresses are assigned.

## Address-of operator (&)

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << x << '\n';  // print the value of variable x
    std::cout << &x << '\n'; // print the memory address of variable x

    return 0;
}
```

Retrieves the address assigned to variable x. Usually hexadecimal values.

## The dereference operator

The dereference operator * returns the value at a given memory address as an lvalue:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << x << '\n';  // print the value of variable x
    std::cout << &x << '\n'; // print the memory address of variable x

    std::cout << *(&x) << '\n'; // print the value at the memory address of variable x (parentheses not required, but make it easier to read)

    return 0;
}
```

## Pointer

A pointer is an object that holds a memory address as its value. This allows us to store the address of some other object to use later.

Declared using an asterisk:

```c++
int;  // a normal int
int&; // an lvalue reference to an int value

int*; // a pointer to an int value (holds the address of an integer value)
```

Pointer variable:

```c++
int main()
{
    int x { 5 };    // normal variable
    int& ref { x }; // a reference to an integer (bound to x)

    int* ptr;       // a pointer to an integer

    return 0;
}
```

### Pointer intitialization

A pointer that has not been initialized is called a wild pointer. Always initialize your pointers to a known value.

```c++
int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };

    int* ptr;        // an uninitialized pointer (holds a garbage address)
    int* ptr2{};     // a null pointer (we'll discuss these in the next lesson)
    int* ptr3{ &x }; // a pointer initialized with the address of variable x

    return 0;
}
```

The value of a pointer has to be an address. They're typically used to hold the address of another variable. 

We then can use the dereference operators * to access the value at that address:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << x << '\n'; // print the value of variable x

    int* ptr{ &x }; // ptr holds the address of x
    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // use dereference operator to print the value at the address that ptr is holding (which is x's address)

    return 0;
}
```

Type of pointer has to match the type of the object being pointed to:

```c++
int main()
{
    int i{ 5 };
    double d{ 7.0 };

    int* iPtr{ &i };     // ok: a pointer to an int can point to an int object
    int* iPtr2 { &d };   // not okay: a pointer to an int can't point to a double object
    double* dPtr{ &d };  // ok: a pointer to a double can point to a double object
    double* dPtr2{ &i }; // not okay: a pointer to a double can't point to an int object

    return 0;
}
```

### Pointers and assignment

We can use assignment in two ways:

1. Change what the pointer is pointing at
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int* ptr{ &x }; // ptr initialized to point at x

    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // print the value at the address being pointed to (x's address)

    int y{ 6 };
    ptr = &y; // // change ptr to point at y

    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // print the value at the address being pointed to (y's address)

    return 0;
}
```
2. Change the value being pointed at
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int* ptr{ &x }; // initialize ptr with address of variable x

    std::cout << x << '\n';    // print x's value
    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // print the value at the address that ptr is holding (x's address)

    *ptr = 6; // The object at the address held by ptr (x) assigned value 6 (note that ptr is dereferenced here)

    std::cout << x << '\n';
    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // print the value at the address that ptr is holding (x's address)

    return 0;
}
```

### Pointers behave much like lvalue references

Pointers and references both provide a way to indirectly access another object. Main difference is that with pointers, we need to explicitly get the address to point at, and we have to dereference the pointer to get the value. Address-of and dereference happens implicitly with references.

### Address-of operator returns a pointer

Address-of operator doesn't return the address of its operand as a literal. Returns a pointer containing the address of the operand.

### Size of pointer

Size of pointer is dependent upon the architecture the executable is compiled for. Always the same though because a pointer is just a memory address.

### Dangling pointers

A dangling pointer is a poitner that is holding the address of an object that is no longer valid.

Dereferencing a dangling point will lead to undefined behavior.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int* ptr{ &x };

    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // valid

    {
        int y{ 6 };
        ptr = &y;

        std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // valid
    } // y goes out of scope, and ptr is now dangling

    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // undefined behavior from dereferencing a dangling pointer

    return 0;
}
```
