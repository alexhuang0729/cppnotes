# Null pointers

Pointers can hold null values--values that mean something has no value

```c++
int main()
{
    int* ptr {}; // ptr is now a null pointer, and is not holding an address

    return 0;
}
```

A null pointer can later be changed to point to a valid object:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int* ptr {}; // ptr is a null pointer, and is not holding an address

    int x { 5 };
    ptr = &x; // ptr now pointing at object x (no longer a null pointer)

    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // print value of x through dereferenced ptr

    return 0;
}
```

## nullptr keyword

To denote a null pointer, we can use the nullptr keyword as a null pointer literal.

```c++
int main()
{
    int* ptr { nullptr }; // can use nullptr to initialize a pointer to be a null pointer

    int value { 5 };
    int* ptr2 { &value }; // ptr2 is a valid pointer
    ptr2 = nullptr; // Can assign nullptr to make the pointer a null pointer

    someFunction(nullptr); // we can also pass nullptr to a function that has a pointer parameter

    return 0;
}
```

## Don't dereference null pointers!!

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int* ptr {}; // Create a null pointer
    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // Dereference the null pointer

    return 0;
}
```

Since null pointers don't point to any address, dereferencing, which is accessing the address the pointer is pointing at and access the value there, doesn't make sense.

## Checking for null pointers

Use conditional o test whether a pointer has value:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };
    int* ptr { &x };

    if (ptr == nullptr) // explicit test for equivalence
        std::cout << "ptr is null\n";
    else
        std::cout << "ptr is non-null\n";

    int* nullPtr {};
    std::cout << "nullPtr is " << (nullPtr==nullptr ? "null\n" : "non-null\n"); // explicit test for equivalence

    return 0;
}
```

Pointers implicitly convert to boolean valus:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };
    int* ptr { &x };

    // pointers convert to Boolean false if they are null, and Boolean true if they are non-null
    if (ptr) // implicit conversion to Boolean
        std::cout << "ptr is non-null\n";
    else
        std::cout << "ptr is null\n";

    int* nullPtr {};
    std::cout << "nullPtr is " << (nullPtr ? "non-null\n" : "null\n"); // implicit conversion to Boolean

    return 0;
}
```

## Use nullptr to avoid dangling pointers

Use a conditional to ensure a pointer is non-null before trying to dereference it:

```c++
// Assume ptr is some pointer that may or may not be a null pointer
if (ptr) // if ptr is not a null pointer
    std::cout << *ptr << '\n'; // okay to dereference
else
    // do something else that doesn't involve dereferencing ptr (print an error message, do nothing at all, etc...)
```

Avoid having dangling pointers in the first place by ensuring they all are set to nullptr.

## Use references over pointers

Because references can't be bound to null, we don't have to worry about null references. References must be bound to a valid object.
