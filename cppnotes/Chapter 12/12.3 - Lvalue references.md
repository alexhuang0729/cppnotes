# Lvalue References

A reference is an alias for an existing object.  An operation on the reference is applied to the object being referenced. We use a reference to read or modify the object being referenced.

Two types of references: lvalue references and rvalue references.
[[12.2 - Value categories (lvalues and rvalues)]]
## Lvalue reference types

We use ampersand in the type declaration:
```c++
int      // a normal int type
int&     // an lvalue reference to an int object
double&  // an lvalue reference to a double object
```

## Lvalue reference variables

An lvalue reference variable is a variable that acts as as a reference to an lvalue. 

To create an lvalue reference variable, we define a variable with an lvalue reference type:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };    // x is a normal integer variable
    int& ref { x }; // ref is an lvalue reference variable that can now be used as an alias for variable x

    std::cout << x << '\n';  // print the value of x (5)
    std::cout << ref << '\n'; // print the value of x via ref (5)

    return 0;
}
```

## Modifying values through an lvalue reference

Can use a reference to modify the value of the object being referenced:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 }; // normal integer variable
    int& ref { x }; // ref is now an alias for variable x

    std::cout << x << ref << '\n'; // print 55

    x = 6; // x now has value 6

    std::cout << x << ref << '\n'; // prints 66

    ref = 7; // the object being referenced (x) now has value 7

    std::cout << x << ref << '\n'; // prints 77

    return 0;
}
```

ref is an alias for x, so we are able to change the value of x through either x or ref.

## Initialization of lvalue references

Like constants, all references must be initialized. 

```c++
int main()
{
    int& invalidRef;   // error: references must be initialized

    int x { 5 };
    int& ref { x }; // okay: reference to int is bound to int variable

    return 0;
}
```

When a reference is initialized with an object (or function), we say it is bound to that object (or function). This is called reference binding. The object (or function) being referenced is called the referent. 

```c++
int main()
{
    int x { 5 };
    int& ref { x }; // valid: lvalue reference bound to a modifiable lvalue

    const int y { 5 };
    int& invalidRef { y };  // invalid: can't bind to a non-modifiable lvalue
    int& invalidRef2 { 0 }; // invalid: can't bind to an rvalue

    return 0;
}
```

Lvalue references can't be bound to non-modifiable lvalues or rvalues. lvalue references are called lvalue references to non-const. 

Most of the time, the type of the reference must match the type of the referent. 

```c++
int main()
{
    int x { 5 };
    int& ref { x }; // okay: reference to int is bound to int variable

    double y { 6.0 };
    int& invalidRef { y }; // invalid; reference to int cannot bind to double variable
    double& invalidRef2 { x }; // invalid: reference to double cannot bind to int variable

    return 0;
}
```

## References can't be reseated

References can't be reseat, or changed to reference another object.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };
    int y { 6 };

    int& ref { x }; // ref is now an alias for x

    ref = y; // assigns 6 (the value of y) to x (the object being referenced by ref)
    // The above line does NOT change ref into a reference to variable y!

    std::cout << x << '\n'; // user is expecting this to print 5

    return 0;
}
```

The above example prints 6 because ref = y doesn't change ref to now reference y. Rather, because ref is an alias for x, the expression evaluates as if it was written x = y--and since y evaluates to value 6, x is assigned the value 6. 

## Lvalue reference scope and duration

Reference variables follow the same scoping and duration rules that normal variables do:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 }; // normal integer
    int& ref { x }; // reference to variable value

     return 0;
} // x and ref die here
```

## References and referents have independent lifetimes

With one exception, the lifetime of a reference and the lifetime of its referent are independent. Both of the following are true:
- A reference can be destroyed before the object it is referencing
- The object being referenced can be destroyed before the reference
When a reference is destroyed before the referent, the referent is not impacted:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };

    {
        int& ref { x };   // ref is a reference to x
        std::cout << ref << '\n'; // prints value of ref (5)
    } // ref is destroyed here -- x is unaware of this

    std::cout << x << '\n'; // prints value of x (5)

    return 0;
} // x destroyed here
```

## Dangling references

When an object being referenced is destroyed before the reference, teh reference is left referencing an object that no longer exists. Such a reference is called a dangling reference. Accessing a dangled reference leads to undefined behavior.

## References aren't objects

References AREN'T objects. A reference is not required to exist or occupy storage. Can't be used anywhere an object is required. If you need a reference that is an object, use stf::reference_wrapper.
